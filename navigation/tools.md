## Version checks
*copied from [tools setup](https://nighthawkcoders.github.io/portfolio_2025/devops/tools/setup)*

```
# Show the active Ruby version, it needs to be 3 or higher
    ruby -v
# Bundler version, it is part of Ruby install
    bundle -v

# Show active Python version, it needs to be 3.10 or better (mine should currently be 3.10.12)
    python --version

# Show Jupyter packages, nbconvert needs to be in the list of installed
    jupyter --version
```

## important shell commands
* **sudo** It is supposed to be used to help manage packages, kasm cannot use this command
* **ls**  Lists current directory, I think you can also do *dir* for a similar result
* **cd** Changes the directory, use . for current, .. for parent and / for seperating movements/children
* **git**  Github commands, such as git pull, git clone, and git config
* **cat**  displays a specific file’s content

## information about the repository
* ### How are the files from GitHub placed on your local machine? How do you navigate to those files?
Files are placed into folders on you local machine, you can navigate to them in your file system like any other file. Vscode centers itself on the folder of your repository, and you can navigate to them in a similar way
* ### How are the files from GitHub placed on your local machine? How do you navigate to those files?
Whenever you push changes to files on your local machine to github, it updates the corresponding files on github. On the github repository site you can navigate to the files much like any file system.
* ### How would you update your template of the portfolio_2025 repository? How would you make it more applicable to your specific course?
You can rename the repository and certain file contents in the copied template. Doing this along with editing other files can create a personal repository you can use during your course.

## localhost vs deployed server
* the **localhost** is bascially your computer, it has the ability to run your websites when you "make", it is not generally acessible by other devices
* **deployed server** is a seperate computer that can return information back to your device, and can be accessed by other devices. The major example here is Github.

## DNS and GitHub Pages
* ###  Is there a domain on your Github Pages
yes, https://trystan-schmits.github.io/, it is a part of github pages
* ### Is the URL for your GitHub Pages different from your neighbors’ URLs? Did you change the URL? If so, when?
it is slightly different from nieghbors urls, the most I can do to change the url is change the name of each repository to be uniquely identifiable
