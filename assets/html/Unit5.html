    <b>Writing Classes</b>: <br>
    This unit comes with one of the main frq questions, Question 2. The purpose is to build classes, a common way to structure and create Objects. <br>
    The FRQ has you write out a class, or a part of a class, with proper structure and functionality.
    It is important to pay attention to the different sections of the class as you are writing it. These sections include: <br>
</p>
<li> Class Header </li>
<li> Constructor </li>
<li> Instance Variables </li>
<li> Methods </li>
