    <b>Inheritance</b>: <br>
    This is personally my favorite unit, and the unit I seem to be the most consistent in. <br>
    Inheritance is the relationship between classes, and allows for many similar classes to be created more efficently.<br>
    You can create the subclass relationhsip to the parent class by: <br>
</p>
<code> class SubClass extends ParentClass {}</code>
<p class="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
    The subclass will then inherit all of the parent's classes attributes/methods. <br>
    The subclass is also able to relate to the parent class by using the <b>super</b> keyword, 
    which allows the subclass to call the parent classes methods and constructor. <br>
  
    <b>Polymorphism</b>: <br>
    <i>I made a lesson on this :)</i> <br>
    Polymorphism allows subclasses to override parent classes methods and ultize them at run time. <br>
</p>
<code>
  <pre>
class ParentClass{
    public void greet(){
      System.out.println("hello");
    }
}

class SubClass extends ParentClass{
    public void greet(){
      System.out.println("hi");
    }
}

ParentClass myClass = new SubClass();
myClass.greet(); //outputs hi
  </pre>
</code>
