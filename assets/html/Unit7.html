    <b>Array Lists</b>: <br>
    Array Lists are very similar to arrays, and share an frq question: question 3.<br>
    Array lists can vary in size during runtime, this means that you can both add and remove values in the array list while the program is running.
    Furthermore is comes with some extra methods such as <code>arrayList.contains(Object value)</code> <br>
</p>
<p class="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
    The FRQ question generally has you create methods that utilize either arrays or arraylists to serve the scenarios purpose <br>
    For example a list of comments could be stored in an array, and you have to find which comments contain some sort of pattern and remove them. <br>

    <b>Array Lists</b>: <br>
    There are a few differences between arrays and arrayLists:
</p>
<li> <code>array.length</code> - size of an array</li>
<li> <code>arrayList.size()</code> - size of an arrayList</li>
<li> <code>array[index]</code> - getting a value at a given index in an array </li>
<li> <code>arrayList.get(index)</code> - getting a value at a given index in an arraylist </li>

    THIS is apparently the topic I struggle the most on in multiple choice questions.
    Although I find the FRQs easier, I still need to create and practice different scenarios where I could use lists and arrays.
