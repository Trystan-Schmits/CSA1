    This unit comes with its own FRQ question: question 4. <br>
    According to college board, question 4 will ask about, 
    <q>Students will be asked to write program code to satisfy method specifications using expressions, conditional statements, and iterative statements and create, traverse, and manipulate elements in 2D array objects.</q>
    <br>
    2D arrays are multidensional arrays and are created by: <br>
</p>
<code>Type[][] 2dArray = new Type[][];</code>
<p class="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
