    The main part of this unit is using object methods, especially those of common classes like String. <br>
    A very tricky method is the String.substring() method. It has 2 variations:<br>
</p>
<li> substring(int index)</li>
<li> substring(int start, int end)</li>
<p class="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
    The difficlt part of these two methods is the when an IndexOutOfBounds Exeption is thrown. <br>
    For example: <br>
</p>
<li><code> ("Hello").substring(5, 6) </code> - causes an error</li>
<li><code> ("Hello").substring(5) </code> - does not</li>
<p class="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
    This is because the first expression asks the string for the character at the 5th index. 
    While the second expression does not.<br>
</p>

    During the Ap exam we will have a reference sheet with all of the methods; 
    but it is still good to remember how each method works.
