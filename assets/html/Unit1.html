    <b>Primative Types</b>: <br>
    This unit does not come with a specifc FRQ question, but the content shows up everywhere. <br>
    Primative types are the most basic type of variable that exist.
    They are stored as raw values directly onto the memory stack for quick access.<br>
    When the executing code leaves the current scoping (for example a method returns), the stack of memory corresponding to the scope is flushed by the garbage collector. <br>
    Primiative types include: <br>
</p>
<li>boolean</li>
<li>byte</li>
<li>short</li>
<li>int</li>
<li>long</li>
<li>float</li>
<li>double</li>
<li>char</li>
<p class="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
    These types take up a limited amount of memory depending on the type.<br>
    In java Every Primative type has a Wrapper class, which is an Object that provides methods for the Primative Type.<br>
    
    <b>References</b>: <br>
    <i>Since I don't want to spend space in the Unit 2 section on this topic, I will put it here.</i><br>
    Java Objects (Reference Types) are stored differently than primatives Type. They use Heap Memory.<br>
    Then after placing the Object in memory, it creates a reference and places it in the stack Memory.<br>
    Once there are no more references to the Object, or the references are out of scope, The garbage Collector removes the Object from the memory heap.
